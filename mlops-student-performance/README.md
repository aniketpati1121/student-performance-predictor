# MLOps Student Performance Prediction System

A production-ready **end-to-end MLOps project** that demonstrates how to build, track, and deploy a machine learning model using modern MLOps practices.

This project focuses on predicting **student performance** and is designed to teach and implement real-world concepts like:
- Modular ML pipelines
- Artifacts and logging
- Model versioning
- Experiment tracking
- Dockerization
- CI/CD automation
- Kubeflow Pipelines (planned)

---

## 🚀 Features

- End-to-end machine learning workflow
- Structured and modular codebase
- Artifact tracking (models, metrics, logs)
- Production-oriented project layout
- Ready for Docker and CI/CD
