# MLOps Student Performance Prediction System

A production-ready **end-to-end MLOps project** that demonstrates how to build, track, and deploy a machine learning model using modern MLOps practices.This project focuses on predicting **student performance** and is designed to teach and implement real-world concepts like:

- Modular ML pipelines
- Artifacts and logging
- Model versioning
- Experiment tracking
- Dockerization
- CI/CD automation
- Kubeflow Pipelines (planned)
